    # Sends an object to the other end of the channel, if it is connected. 
    # If it is not connected, objects sent will queue up and once the internal
    # storage reaches the high watermark, they will be dropped silently. 
    #
    # Example: 
    #   channel.put :object
    #   # Really, any Ruby object that the current serializer can turn into 
    #   # a string!
    #
    def put(obj)
