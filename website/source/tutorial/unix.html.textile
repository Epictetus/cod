h1. Tricks

This is a collection of tricks for handling the offspring your processes fork
and related topics. 

h2. The Self Pipe

When using processes instead of threads, you will sooner or later have to
handle signals using <code>Kernel.trap</code>.[4] To be able to integrate this
nicely with the rest of your code that probably blocks in
<code>Cod.select</code> as much as possible, you can use the self-pipe
trick. 

Rather than cover what a self-pipe is again, I refer you to the
"extensive":http://cr.yp.to/docs/selfpipe.html
"documentation":http://osiris.978.org/~alex/safesignalhandling.html
"online":http://blog.rubybestpractices.com/posts/ewong/016-Implementing-Signal-Handlers.html.
'cause this is an old trick!

Using _cod_, it boils down to this: 

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code title="Self Pipe trick">
  self_pipe = Cod.pipe.split
  # Register a handler for USR1
  trap(:USR1) { self_pipe.write.put :USR1 }

  Process.kill(:USR1, 
    Process.pid)
  
  # Do something without worrying about signals
  
  # Here's the advantage of self-pipe: You can 
  # decide when to listen for signals. Otherwise 
  # trap is very preemptive.
  self_pipe.read.get # => :USR1
</code></pre>

Did you notice that a split pipe returns an array that also answers to 
<code>#read</code> and <code>#write</code>? This is useful for when you cannot
come up with a name for both ends, as in the above example. 


h1. Gotchas

All is not butter and honey in the land of forks. As it is the case with 
every style of programming, there are a number of things to be aware of. 
This section of the tutorial strives to give you a heads-up to most of them. 
Please tell me if something is missing. 

h2. Forks flush io streams

Ruby buffers output sent to IO streams for a while. So does the operating 
system. When you fork a new process, the OS buffers get flushed to disk while
the Ruby buffers get duplicated into the new process. (Along with the open file descriptor)

Ruby buffers get flushed at other moments, like when you write more output to
the IO stream or when a child process exits. And the drama unfolds: Your child
processes will write the unflushed Ruby buffers to the open IO stream upon
exit. Their master process will write the same buffer to the same stream on
its next write. And you'll end up with duplicated file contents.

To prevent this from happening: Either flush the streams before you fork

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  stream.flush
</code></pre>

or have them synch to OS buffers immediately on write

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  stream.sync = true
</code></pre>

or even better - don't let the child inherit the stream in the first place. 
This can only be achieved by opening the stream after the fork. 

h2. Signal handling might mess up library X

While the previous gotcha was more of a Ruby bug, this is a unix problem: 
When you use signals in your Ruby program, you might mess up C extensions 
you use. Without signal handling, someone might write the following C code: 

<pre class="sh_c"><code>
   size = recv(socket, &buffer, 1024, 0);
   assert(size > 0);
   // Do something with the data in buffer
</code></pre>

But once you register a trap for a signal (<code>man 2 sigaction</code>),
signals might have to be delivered to your process during the blocking call to
<code>recv</code>. What your OS will do in this case is really simple and
never happens until you register a <code>sigaction</code>: It returns from the
<code>recv</code> call with an exit code of -1. (and an <code>_errno</code> of
EAGAIN)

You could not care less. This marks the precise spot where that library
becomes useless to you, since you'd have to read all the code back and fix all
instances where calls are made to the operating system with the wrong set of
assumptions. Now you know at least where that assertion fault (or EAGAIN error) all over sudden comes from.

h2. COW-friendliness of various Rubies

Your average Ruby is not copy-on-write friendly. This means that even though
right after a fork, you don't use double the memory you used in that parent
process, some time afterwards you will, since the garbage collector Ruby uses
will touch all that memory, creating a child copy of it. 

If you create short-lived processes, this is not a problem. And if you create
long-lived server processes - just thought I'd give you the heads-up. 
Try to google for Ruby and 'Copy on Write' - you'll find prior art. 

h1. Other things to look at

Some excellent books have been written about Unix. I personally did enjoy
reading 'Advanced Programming in the UNIX environment' (Stevens, Rago). But
hey, "who am I":http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/1995-06-24/ to tell you that you should read a book.
