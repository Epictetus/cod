This is a work in progress...

Want to watch this happen? Here's a list of things I've worked on recently
and what I changed: 

h2. 2012-03-30

* "tutorial/unix":tutorial/unix.html Headlines only; stuff that you need to
  be aware of in this mode of programming.
* "tutorial/pipe":tutorial/pipes.html A few examples and the example runner.
  Examples for a lot of the pattern you'd need in reality.
  
Come back later - this is undergoing frequent changes.
