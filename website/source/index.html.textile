h1. SYNOPSIS

Here's a time server implementation that you can know by heart: 

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  time_server_channel = Cod.tcp_server('10.0.0.2:4444')
  
  loop do
    request, client_channel = time_server_channel.get_ext
    case request
      when :time
        client_channel.put Time.now
      when :date
        client_channel.put Date.today
    else
      client_channel.put 'Unknown request!'
    end
    
    client_channel.close
  end
</code></pre>

Here's the client: 

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  time_chan = Cod.tcp('10.0.0.2:4444')
  time = time_chan.interact(:time)
  
  puts "At the next clock cycle, it is #{time}."
</code></pre>

h1. DOCUMENTATION

Some. 

Here's the "who's who":tutorial/pipes.html of the _cod_ universe. This is
what you see in the navigation bar as well.

Here, have some "YARD documentation":http://rubydoc.org/gems/cod as a side dish. 

Don't read the source code. There, I've warned you.
