  <body onload="sh_highlightDocument();"><h1>Pipes</h1>
<p>A pipe is a descriptor pair for interprocess communication.<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> It allows data
to flow in one direction, from its read end to the write end. In a way, a 
pipe is the prototypical <em>cod</em> channel; they have been standing model for how
channels work.</p>
<p>Pipes are mainly used to communicate with subprocesses; they can be accessed
by everyone in the process group of the creating process. The patterns shown
here will illustrate what real uses such communication can have.</p>
<p>Pipes can be closed on either end. If the last write end is closed, further
reads will raise a <code>Cod::ConnectionLost[2]</code>.</p>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>Pipes in <em>cod</em> are constructed using</p>
<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  Cod.pipe
</code></pre>
<p>This returns a pipe that is either to be used for writing or for reading, 
but never both. If you really need both ends of a pipe in one and the same
process, you should use either of these two obtain two copies:</p>
<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  # either call #dup
  copy = pipe.dup

  # or call #split (this closes pipe)
  read, write = pipe.split
</code></pre>
<p>The penalty for not doing this is exceptions, so there, I warned you.</p>
<h2>Communicate with Subprocesses, 101</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume we want to run a subprocess and have it produce a value for us.
This is really a solved problem<sup class="footnote" id="fnr3"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>, but let&#8217;s assume it isn&#8217;t. <em>cod</em> makes
this easy:</p>
<pre class="sh_ruby"><code title="Heavy Computation">
  def heavy_computation # nomen est omen
    41 + 1
  end
  
  channel = Cod.pipe
  fork do
    channel.put heavy_computation()
  end

  channel.get   # =&gt; 42
</code></pre>
<p>No need to stop the world just to get a simple answer; you fork a subprocess
and read the answer from a <em>cod</em> channel.</p>
<p>A few things to note. <em>cod</em> is a friendly fellow, it communicates in Ruby values by default. This frequently comes in very handy indeed. If you happen
to run into one of the infrequent cases where this bothers you, please skip
ahead to the chapter on <a href="serialisation.html">serialisation</a>.</p>
<p>Also, <em>cod</em> will often block if you issue a <code>#get</code>. This is really
a feature, not a bug. If you need to wait for new data to come in while doing
other work, please look at <a href="select.html">Cod.select</a></p>
<p>Have a look at this nifty trick:</p>
<pre class="sh_ruby"><code title="Passing back exceptions">
  channel = Cod.pipe
  fork do
    begin
      fail "Meanwhile, back at the ranch:"
    rescue =&gt; ex
      channel.put ex
    end
  end
  
  channel.get   # =&gt; 
</code></pre>
