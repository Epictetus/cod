A small queue like example. 

run ruby send.rb N to send N messages through queue.rb to client.rb. 
Client will print statistics (calls per second) every 100 messages.

Problems: 
  - queue.rb seems to always consume 100% CPU
  - number of messages per second is way low
  - some exceptions are still not handled correctly
