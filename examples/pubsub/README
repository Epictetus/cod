This is an example of PUB/SUB style messaging. You should run one directory
and any number of clients. All clients should receive timestamps from the directory, once every second. 

Experiments that can be made using this setup: 

1) Disconnect a client, restart it. It should start receiving updates
immediately.

2) Disconnect the directory, restart it. It should start redistributing
updates to all clients within 5 seconds.
